# Creating-customer-segment-using-unsupervised-learning
Using unsupervised learning to get the customer based of a mail sales order company.

This project involves a real-life data provided by a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.

Two datasets will be provided. One with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. 

This project entails using unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
